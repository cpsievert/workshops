## A minimal bar chart

* Every **plotly** chart is powered by [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js), plus some extra R/JS magic `r emo::ji("tophat")` `r emo::ji("rabbit")`.
* How/why did `plot_ly()` draw a bar chart? What if we want something different?

## Your turn

In your R console enter:

```r
file.edit('~/day1/your-turn.R')
```

Work through the comments/code/questions in this R script.

Feel free to work with your neighbor and ask me questions!

.footnote[
If you have question(s) about it **rmarkdown**, now would be a good time to ask (we won't have time to cover it together).

**PS.** Did you know [the workshop slides](index.Rmd) were created with **rmarkdown**?

The **scatter** trace type is quite general. It provides the foundation for many charts (e.g., [polygons](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/geom_polygon/), [ribbons](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/geom_ribbon/), [filled areas](https://plot.ly/r/filled-area-plots/), etc), extends to different coordinate systems (e.g, [scatter3d](https://plot.ly/r/3d-line-plots/), [scattergeo](https://plot.ly/r/bubble-maps/), and [scattermapbox](https://plot.ly/r/scattermapbox/)), and rendering systems (e.g., [scattergl](https://plot.ly/r/webgl-vs-svg/))

These questions drive at least two influential papers:

<h2 align="center"> Your turn </h2>

Have a look at some plotly "extension" packages!
  * [heatmaply](https://github.com/talgalili/heatmaply#readme)
  * [iheatmapr](https://github.com/ropensci/iheatmapr#readme)
  * [visdat](http://visdat.njtierney.com/articles/experimental_features.html#interactivity)
  * [vistime](https://github.com/shosaco/vistime#readme)
  * [ggplotgui](https://github.com/gertstulp/ggplotgui#readme)
  
  
.footnote[
**Exercise**: Most of these packages have a function that returns a plotly object (e.g., `heatmaply::heatmaply()`). Use a plotly function to modify/customize the result (e.g., add a title with `plotly::layout()`) 

For all CRAN packages that use plotly, see the "Reverse dependencies" section on <https://cran.r-project.org/package=plotly>

## What about *long* time series?

* *Tens* of thousands points is responsive with *SVG*

```{r, code=readLines("06-rangeslider.R")}
```

<a href="06-rangeslider.html" target="_blank">
 <div align="center">
   <img src="svg.png" width="100%" />
 </div>
</a>

---
## What about *long* time series?

* *Hundreds* of thousands time series points is responsive with *WebGL* (but [no rangeslider (yet)](https://community.plot.ly/t/is-there-a-way-to-keep-the-range-slider-while-using-scattergl/4556/3))

```{r, code=readLines("07-webgl.R")}
```

<a href="07-webgl.html" target="_blank">
 <div align="center">
   <img src="webgl.png" width="100%" />
 </div>
</a>

---
## What about performance (beyond time-series)?

### SVG vs Canvas, in general

* The *Scalable* in SVG, means scalable in terms of bounding box size.
  * No matter the context, your browser will struggle to render > 30,000 SVG elements.
  * This is why [canvas based elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element) exist (the difference is similar to pdf vs png)
  
#### Time series doesn't scale well, even in a canvas context 

* Time series has performance limitations that other data types don't (this is pretty universal).

### High performance plotly charts

* scattergl -- basically same as scatter (with [limitations](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/130)), but [responsive with >1M points](scattergl.R).
* pointcloud -- more restricted than scattergl, but [responsive w/ several million points](pointcloud.R).
* heatmapgl -- [response with >1M cells](heatmapgl.R) in heatmap.

## More time series tips

#### Have *lots* of *long* time series?

* Consider [extracting/visualizing features from each series](https://robjhyndman.com/talks/Google-Oct2015-part3.pdf)
  * Some useful packages: [anomalous](https://github.com/robjhyndman/anomalous) and [tscognostics](https://github.com/earowang/tscognostics)
  * See my work on [visualizing pedestrian traffic](https://github.com/cpsievert/pedestrians) with plotly
  
* Consider a tool like [trelliscope](http://ryanhafen.com/blog/trelliscopejs-plotly) for exploring many "groups"

#### Visualization of models/predictions?

* Start with [forecast](https://cran.r-project.org/package=forecast) and/or [mgcv](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mgcv) for model fitting.
* Use a strategy similar to [here](https://plotly-book.cpsievert.me/a-case-study-of-housing-sales-in-texas.html#fig:forecast) to plot forecasts.

#### Is seasonality important?

* Consider "wrapping" your time-series 
  * Wrap (i.e., group) your series by hand (get inspired by this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6675.pdf))
  * Checkout out [sugrrants](https://github.com/earowang/sugrrants) (`ggplotly()` converts the ggplot2 plots)

## Texas housing prices

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
tx <- txhousing %>%
  select(city, year, month, median) %>%
  filter(city %in% c("Galveston", "Midland", "Odessa", "South Padre Island"))
tx
```

---
## Wrap by year, facet by city

```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(tx, aes(month, median, group = year)) + geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~city, ncol = 2)
```

---
## Compare across cities within year *and* across years within city

## Your turn

Visit [this post](http://ryanhafen.com/blog/trelliscopejs-plotly), replicate the example (no install needed), and use trelliscope to visualize `txhousing` (or, more preferably, your own data!)
