<h1 class="title toc-ignore">‘plotly for R’ workshop</h1>
<h4 class="author"><em><a href="https://cpsievert.me/">Carson Sievert</a></em></h4>

<div id="about-the-workshop" class="section level1">
<h1>About the workshop</h1>
<p>This workshop is highly interactive and attendees are expected to participate in hands-on exercises designed to reinforce the lecture material. To participate in the exercises, attendees should bring a laptop and make sure they can open <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/project/14090">this RStudio Cloud project</a> before the workshop begins.</p>
<p>By the end of this workshop, you will be able to rapidly pose queries about data with interactive web graphics made using <a href="https://plot.ly/r/">the R package plotly</a>. You will also learn about useful <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> tools and concepts such as <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html">tidy data</a>, data reshaping data, and the <a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01">split-apply-combine technique</a>. Though it would be beneficial to have some prior knowledge of R and <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, we do not require it, and as such, we avoid assuming pre-existing knowledge as much as possible. Furthermore, this workshop is <em>not</em> designed to make you an R programming expert – it’s designed to get you <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-hard-way/">doing powerful things quickly</a> regardless of your experience with R or programming in general.</p>
