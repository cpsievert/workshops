## About my workshops

Attendees expected to bring laptop with relevant R packages installed.

The slides and materials are published online (under Creative Commons).

Blend of lecture, coding demos, and hands-on exercises.

Comfortable managing 5-20 attendees...anymore requires assistance.

## About this workshop

* Essentially a re-hash of my [plotcon workshop](https://plotcon17.cpsievert.me/workshop/)

* Day 1: Getting (re)-acquainted with R, RStudio, data wrangling, ggplot2, and plotly
  * Basic R syntax and data structures
  * Using `ggplotly()` to convert ggplot2 to plotly
  * Using `layout()`/`style()` to modify plotly objects
  * Tips and info for getting "un-stuck"
    
* Day 2: Advanced plotly
  * Animation
  * Highlighting/filtering in multiple linked views
  * Capturing plotly events in shiny

# Examples of what students learn

## Modern ggplot2 mapping

```{r}
library(plotly)
usa <- albersusa::usa_sf("laea")
p <- ggplot(usa) + geom_sf(aes(fill = pop_2010)) 
ggplotly(p)
```


<iframe src="map.html" width="100%" height="500" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

---

## Various ways to customize

```{r}
p <- ggplot(usa) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = pop_2010, text = paste(name, "had", pop_2010, "\n in 2010"))) 
style(ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text"), hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = "white"))
```

## Define custom interactions

## The code

```{r}
library(crosstalk)
usd <- SharedData$new(usa)
p <- ggplot(usd) + geom_sf(aes(fill = pop_2010))
highlight(
  ggplotly(p), "plotly_hover", opacityDim = 0.8,
  selected = attrs_selected(line = list(color = "black"))
)
```
