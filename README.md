# workshops

Slides and materials for various workshops (and webinars) I've held. You can browse them on the homepage -- <https://workshops.cpsievert.me>

## Note to self

To create a new slide deck give `new.R` a date in form YYYYMMDD

```shell
Rscript new.R 20160131
```

The second argument is optional, in case we want a different template someday:

```shell
Rscript new.R 20160131 ioslides
```

To update the homepage/table:

```shell
Rscript table.R
```
