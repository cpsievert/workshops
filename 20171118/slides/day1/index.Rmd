## Your Turn

(1) Install the required software <https://workshops.cpsievert.me/20171118/>

(2) Run the docker container so that RStudio appears when you visit <http://localhost:8787>

(3) Using the Files pane in RStudio, click `day1` folder, then `index.html`, and choose 'View in web browser'.

(4) Share (with your neighbor) 3 things you're hoping to take away from this workshop (share them with me, via [Slack](https://plotconrworkshop.slack.com) if you like!)

PS. remember this background image -- it means I want something from you!

## Is there anything in particular that you would like covered?

* I'm most interested in **linking and animating views without shiny**. Already pretty well acquainted with R/RStudio/Plotly, but hoping to learn how to use Plotly more efficiently and extend my current usage with animation, crosstalk, etc.  I use Plotly most often within flexdashboard applications, so most interested in non-Shiny options.
* I want to learn how to **animate my plotly graphs/charts.**
* More **shiny** dev
* **Creating documents with data visualizations in Markdown files**. I've been working to get better with Markdown, but if there's a way to include interactive visualizations and/or animations in Markdown files that can be sent to readers that would be great. I work in consulting so I often need to send reports to executives and including interactive data visualizations in those reports would be incredibly useful for me.
* Looks good! Stoked for the class. For me, I **don't use rmarkdown** and rarely use ggplot2 - so those could be dropped from the list.
* Looks like all of Day1 currently would be old news. Wouldn't **half a day of R/RStudio/ggplot2** suffice for your audience?

## Is there anything else that we can help you with at the workshop?

* I'd like to know how plotly performs with displaying **large data** sets
* Plotting large amounts of **time series** data efficiently
* Plotly custom **controls and mapping** options. 
* Learn how to apply **interactive filters** in Plotly if that's supported (e.g. click on a single bar within a bar chart on the left which filters the heat-map to the right). 
* More advanced visualization techniques such as a chord diagram or a sunburst 
  * Check out [sunburstR](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/sunburstR)
* Suggestions/hints on how to create clean, **good code** would be especially appreciated.
* **Extended breakout session** time for help on specific project i am bringing 

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  eval = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE,
  fig.width = 10,
  fig.height = 4
)
```

## A minimal bar chart

* Every **plotly** chart is powered by [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js), plus some extra R/JS magic `r emo::ji("tophat")` `r emo::ji("rabbit")`.
* How/why did `plot_ly()` draw a bar chart? What if we want something different?

```{r}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(x = c("A", "B"), y = 1:2)
```

## Your Turn

Open the `day1/your-turn/01.R` script and work through the comments/code/questions.

Feel free to work with your neighbor and ask me questions!

## Scatter modes

The scatter trace type is quite general and syntax extends to WebGL (scattergl), 3D (scatter3d), Geo (scattergeo), and [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) (scattermapbox).

```{r}
subplot(shareY = TRUE,
  plot_ly(x = 1:2, y = 1:2),
  plot_ly(x = 1:2, y = 1:2, mode = "lines"),
  plot_ly(x = 1:2, y = 1:2, mode = "markers+lines"),
  plot_ly(x = 1:2, y = 1:2, text = 1:2, mode = "text"),
  plot_ly(x = 1:2, y = 1:2, text = 1:2, mode = "markers+lines+text")
)
```
