```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(learnr)
library(rmarkdown)
library(shiny)
```

This is a [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) document. It's a special type of [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document, which is powered by [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), and allows one to re-execute R code in the browser. Go ahead and click 
  
```{r a, exercise=TRUE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(x = c("A", "B"), y = 1:2)
```

Given data, but no "trace type" (i.e., "chart type"), the `plot_ly()` function infers a sensible chart (note the message provided):

```{r b, exercise=TRUE}
plot_ly(x = 1:2, y = 1:2)
```

# Note the differences in the message and result...

```{r c, exercise=TRUE}
plot_ly(x = 1:2, y = 1:2, z = 2:1)
```
